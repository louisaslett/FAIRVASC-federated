# Linear Regression Example

This is the simple first-pass linear regression example.
To run this example, please step through the `linreg.sh` file while using this folder as your working directory.

**Note:** This version is purely to demonstrate the sufficient statistics required to fit a standard linear regression, but no additional homomorphic secret sharing privacy is implemented here yet.

A video walkthrough of an earlier version of this is available linked from this Basecamp message (done for privacy on this public repo): [https://3.basecamp.com/4532434/buckets/26575838/messages/4737664963](https://3.basecamp.com/4532434/buckets/26575838/messages/4737664963).
The main change is that you don't need to build the Dockerfile yourself if using Codespaces, so the shell script has slightly simplified.
